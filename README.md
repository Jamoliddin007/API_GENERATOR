# ðŸš€ API Generator (FastAPI)

API Generator is a dynamic backend automation platform built with **FastAPI**.  
It allows users to create, manage, and expose project-specific CRUD APIs on separate subdomains **without writing backend code** for each new project.

This platform is designed to:
- Support multiple independent projects
- Dynamically generate APIs based on user-defined models
- Separate admin and client permissions
- Provide secure access via Bearer tokens
- Allow integration with external backend services
